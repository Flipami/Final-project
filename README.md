# Final-project

## Introduction
My final project is an app for a internal translations auction. Only if you have passed the test could be register, so itÂ´s a private app.

The main object is that translators have the access to the translations and avoid to call them and look for the appropiate person, we have a qualified translators that could check the job and offer their services if they have availability.
